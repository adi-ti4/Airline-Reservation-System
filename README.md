# Airline-Reservation-System

**SQL Project**

The Airline Reservation System is designed to manage flight details, customer records, bookings, and seat availability in an efficient manner. 
It ensures that passengers can reserve seats in real time while airlines can track bookings, cancellations, and occupancy. 
The system goes beyond simple reservations to provide insights into flight demand, cancellation trends, and customer behaviour.
